Project Version History - PLC Automation Portfolio Project
Versioning follows the format: vA.B.C

A = Major project phase (e.g., Safety integration, HMI/SCADA integration)

B = Major feature changes (e.g, adding stations/features)

C = Minor changes

This file contains information on the major (B) versions of the project. 
For detailed logic-level, and scene layout changes, refer to:

v1.0.1 - Basic Implementation of Stage 1: Part Detection
This version implements the first stage in the manufacturing process. Raw materials are transported via conveyor and evaluated by a vision sensor. Parts detected as metal or unknown are rejected by a pneumatic pusher into a removal chute. 

Key features:
- State machine runs in continuous RUNNING mode
- Vision sensor output logic processed using 4-bit input
- Rejection decision logic based on sensor classification
- Pusher activated when diffuser  sensor at entry detects a rejected object

FactoryIO Scene: v1.1
Status: Completed

v1.1.0 - Operator Controls added; Start, Stop, Reset, Emergency Stop
Added Operator Panel control to trigger Start and Stop conditions

Key Features:
- Stage 1 state machine transitions using operator triggers
- Operator buttons light up when they can be pressed (state based)

FactoryIO Scene: v1.2
Status: Completed

v1.x.x - Stage 2 added: Base Manufacturing
Expands system to include a CNC machining station for transforming accepted raw materials into processed component bases. 

Key Features (Planned):
- Machining Station Start/Stop implemented by state machine (IDLE -> WAITING -> RUNNING -> COMEPLTE)
- When Machining Station enters RUNNING, Stage 1 is automatically triggered to enter RUNNING as well, synchronising the material supply with the machining process
- Implements a storage buffer downstream Station 2 to ensure continuous operation of the overall process
- If storage buffer is full, Station 2 transitions to IDLE after COMPLETE, otherwise continue operation
- Storage buffer uses two diffuser sensors (entry and exit) to determine if it is full or not, and a stop blade actuator to control output 

FactoryIO Scene: vx.x
Status: Planned
